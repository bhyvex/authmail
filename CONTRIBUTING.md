# Contributing to AuthMail

AuthMail is open source, and we welcome community contributions! The basic
guidelines are thus:

1. Fork the repository to your own account.
2. Make any necessary changes in a well-named branch. Add tests.
3. Submit a pull request!

And yes, we do require tests for pull requests even though the app itself is
not fully tested. It helps us improve the test suite and better understand what
you're trying to add.

## Adding Functionality

You can look at the [issues page](https://github.com/divshot/authmail/issues) for
an idea of what's on the roadmap. We're trying to document everything on issues so
that you know what's coming.

If you want to add major functionality that isn't already reported as an issue, we
encourage you to raise it as an issue for discussion before putting in work. We'd
hate you to go to the effort of coding up a pull request for something that we don't
see as fitting in with the project.
